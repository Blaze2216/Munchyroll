# Munchyroll
Munchyroll is an ad-free anime streaming web app aimed at minimality and responsive design. 

This project is what I consider to be my best creation, as I've worked on this idea for over 4 years. 

## Features
- **No Ads** - No ads, no popups, no redirects, no bullshit
- **PWA Support** - Munchyroll has PWA (Progressive Web App) support, which means that you can add it to your home screren as an app
- **Time Responsive Background** - The background color changes based on what your local time is. It starts off at a rich yellow in the morning, blue in the afternoon, to a faded red in the evening, and space black in the night
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - The website will scale down to look good on mobile just as it does on desktop
